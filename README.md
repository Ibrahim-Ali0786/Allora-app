# Allora Messenger

One inbox for every conversation. WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, Messenger,
Discord, Slack and X — bridged over Matrix into a single, fast, private app.

## Architecture (v2)

```

State management is **Riverpod** end-to-end. Widgets contain no business
logic: list composition, connection states, disconnect flows and AI calls
all live in `data/` providers & services.

## Key behaviours

* **Disconnect really disconnects.** `AccountLifecycleService` sends the
  bridge `logout`, sticky-marks the network disconnected, and hands every
  portal room to `RoomWipeService`, which removes them **in the foreground,
  instantly** — the UI updates in the same frame. A Workmanager job only
  finishes what a process kill interrupted. If no bridge bot is reachable,
  the app says so honestly: *"Your Allora connection has been removed. You
  may still be logged into the official application."*
* **Live connection status.** `ConnectionManager` maps the Matrix SDK's
  sync stream to `connecting / connected / syncing / reconnecting /
  disconnected / expired / error` with zero polling.
* **AI without shipped keys.** All AI goes through the
  `supabase/functions/allora-ai` edge function (deploy it + set
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). Until then the app shows a clear "AI unreachable"
  message instead of fake responses.
* **Privacy.** Incognito mode (hide typing, hide read receipts, block
  screenshots, no AI history), hidden chats behind the PIN, app lock with
  biometrics, disappearing messages (server retention where allowed + local
  sweeper for your own messages).

## Building

```bash
flutter pub get        # fetches the two new deps: image_picker, local_auth
flutter test
flutter build appbundle
```

See **PLAYSTORE.md** for the release checklist (signing, provisioning
hardening, store listing notes).
